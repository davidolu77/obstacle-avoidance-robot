# ü§ñ Obstacle Avoidance Robot (Arduino UNO + Motor Shield)

This is a DIY autonomous robot that detects and avoids obstacles using an ultrasonic sensor mounted on a servo "head." It was built using an Arduino UNO clone, a motor driver shield, cardboard chassis, and basic electronics.

This project is perfect for beginners learning about robotics, Arduino programming, and sensor-based automation.

## üì¶ Arduino Libraries Required

Install these via **Arduino Library Manager**:

1. ‚úÖ `Adafruit Motor Shield Library` (V1)
2. ‚úÖ `Servo` (built-in)

---

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Upload `obstacle_avoidance_robot.ino` to your Arduino UNO using the Arduino IDE
2. Power the robot using the **2x 18650 battery pack**
3. Place it on the floor and watch it scan, move, and avoid obstacles!
